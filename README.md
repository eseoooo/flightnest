- It features a dashboard with some popular destinations you might like.
- First time users are welcome to create an account.
- Creating an account give users the additional benefit of being able to bookmark/save flights.
- Personal data of users and bookmarks are managed by Google's Firebase platform.
- User database and authentication is also managed by Google's Firebase platform.
- Personal information can be edited and updated on the account tab.
- Continued development in the future.
